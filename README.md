## Question 1
- A program that takes in a Boolean formula and simplifies it using Boolean algebra rules such as De Morgans Law.
- Enter a propositional formula: ~(A ^ (B v C)).
- Simplified formula: (~A v (~B ^ ~C)).

## Question 2
- Program takes a boolean expression as input.
- Outputs whether the expression is True or False (using propositional logic).

## Question 3
- A mock version of the 'Set Game' card game.
- Identifies whether or not the groups of cards is a set.
- In this code, there is a hardcoded set incase there is no set in the randomly generated cards (1, 5, 11).

## Question 4
- This Prolog program is a daily task tracker that allows users to manage their tasks and track their completion status.
- The program supports adding new tasks, marking tasks as completed, querying task completion status, and displaying all tasks with their respective completion statuses.
- It utilizes Prolog predicates such as assert/1 and retract/1 to modify the knowledge base dynamically.
